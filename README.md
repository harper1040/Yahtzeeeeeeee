Hey welcome to my Yahtzeeeeee game. So this is a text based (atm) yahtzee game to play in a terminal. One day at work, a thrift store, someone dropped off a handheld yahtzee game and 
I bought it thinking this would be a good programming project, and here we are. My plans are to give this a gui but I may get lazy and move on to another project. I am still
learning and I'm sure I've made some faux pas along the way, but I had some fun and learned a bit and hope someone can play and enjoy this game.
